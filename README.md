# Supabase by example

This is a Remix/Supabase project demonstrating how to create a user profile along with how to store sensitive data that only the user of that data should be able to view using a one-to-one relationship and row level security (RLS). This project also demonstrates how to use a Postgres function to update two tables (which is done in a transaction so that if one fails there should be a rollback) using a `.rpc` function call. We also demonstrate how to use a generated column for the slug inside the database by making use of a Postgres function we create.

Features:

- Social auth
- Email/Password auth
- Magic Link auth
- OTP auth
- Password reset
- User Profile

This project makes use of:

- [Zod](https://zod.dev/) Schema Validation library
- [Supabase SSR](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/server-side)
- [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/)
- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) e2e testing
- [pgTAP](https://pgtap.org/) Postgres unit testing
- [Tailwind Profile from Codepen](https://codepen.io/ScottWindon/pen/XWdbPLm)

## Getting Started

You can get started with this locally by using the Supabase CLI. Make sure you have the CLI installed before continuing. You can find installation instructions [here](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli).

Clone this project and then install it's dependencies

```bash
npm install # or pnpm install or yarn install
```

Run the command below to start your local Supabase docker instance

```bash
npx supabase start
```

Copy `.env.example` file and rename it `.env`. Now copy the credentials you were given when you ran `supabase start` into this file.

Now we can start the project dev server:

```bash
npm run dev # or yarn dev or pnpm dev
```

We can now navigate to the `/auth/signup` url to create an account.

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `npm run build`

- `build/server`
- `build/client`

## Styling

This template comes with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) already configured for a simple default starting experience. You can use whatever css framework you prefer. See the [Vite docs on css](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#css) for more information.
